title: 7 Apps I Use For Productivity

I use different apps for productivity and I am assuming that you are also using one or planning to use one which is why you are here or maybe you just want to read the blog. So today I decided to share a bunch of the apps I use for productivity.

Now, to be honest I don't use many because I just don't like having to handle so many apps together (if that makes any sense). I just want a very simple place to keep track of everything I want to do, my notes, and other stuff like that. And trust me I'm also a very lazy person when it comes to using apps like this because I feel like it takes a bit more effort, but I try my best to keep some things organized or else it might get so overwhelming. But, when I'm organizing my stuff I feel much lighter.

Before we get into the apps that I use, I would like to share with you a small experience of mine, if you are someone who is looking for a better productivity app. I used to see a lot of people's recommendations on different productivity-related apps and something that I used to do was that I used to download these apps on my computer or phone and keep it there without using or trying it out to see whether I really want to use them, basically lying to myself that I will use them one day. If you ever find yourself doing it then just remove them from your phone or computer because you are literally cluttering your device by doing it. Instead, try each of them out for some time and see whether it is actually working out for you.

Like I said before I don't like having to handle so many apps together, and it will great if there is an app where you can get all this together. And this brings us to the first productivity app that I use.

### **[Notion](https://www.notion.so/)**

Notion is literally amazing. Most articles or videos on Notion say this but that's because it's the truth. I can't believe that I'm saying this because I was so reluctant at using it, and I was just finding reasons to not use it. But, 3 months ago I literally pushed myself to open it and start planning my content for youtube and blog there. And... yeah so I started using it and now I'm really glad I did. The main reason why I use it is that I can have all the things I want to use in one place without having to go back and forth between different apps. Now I use it to write down my notes from different books that I read, my weekly and daily tasks and write down the things that are going through my mind, like different things that I wanna create or learn or anything that is going through my mind because there is literally a lot of things that just keeps going through my mind and it's super hard to control them and I find it easier to write down somewhere. I also kind of started using it for school as well.

You can also import your files from other apps like Evernote and Google Docs, etc. But, for me especially having the option to import Evernote files into Notion is extremely useful since I use Evernote (which I'll be getting into later in this blog) as well and this feature makes it so much easier.

### **[Microsoft OneNote](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-365/onenote/digital-note-taking-app/)**

I use Microsoft OneNote for taking most of my notes. It is a digital notebook that automatically saves and syncs your notes as you work. You can type anything in your notebook or insert it from other apps and web pages. You can take handwritten notes or draw your ideas as well.

One of the best features of it is that you literally draw your ideas out, and for me, that is really useful. All you need is a digital pen and you are good to go.  

### **[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/)**

I use Google Drive for most of my stuff like my notes, photographs, videos, pdfs.

Google Drive is a safe place to back up and access all your files from any device. It is a file storage and is a cloud-based storage solution that allows you to save files online and access them anywhere from any smartphone, tablet, or computer. You can use Drive on your computer or mobile device to securely upload files and edit them online. Drive also makes it easy for others to edit and collaborate on files.

### **[Evernote](https://evernote.com/)**

Evernote helps you capture and prioritize ideas, projects, and to-do lists, so nothing falls through the cracks. The app allows users to create notes, which can be text, drawings, photographs, or even saved web content. Evernote is a free app for your smartphone or computer that stores everything you could possibly imagine losing track of, like a boarding pass, receipt, an article you want to read, a to-do list, or even a simple typed note. The app works brilliantly, keeping everything in sync between your computer, smartphone, or tablet.

I use Evernote and Notion for note-taking but it mostly depends upon what I want to use it for.

### **[Microsoft To-Do](https://to-do.microsoft.com/tasks/)**

Microsoft To-Do is a cloud-based task management application. It allows users to manage their tasks from a smartphone, tablet, and computer. Microsoft To-Do provides you with a full-featured to-do list, complete with notes, reminders, attachments, and the ability to share lists with others. Microsoft To-Do is said to be a good option especially for former users of Wunderlist.

Which have never used by the way, so I don't know much about that. I have been using Microsoft To-Do for the longest time. It is one of the apps that I have stuck with longer than any other To-do app that I have used before. And in my opinion, it is one of the best To-do apps that are out there.

It's a simple to-do list that makes it easy to plan your day. Whether it's for work, school, home, or anything else.

### **[Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar?tab=wc&authuser=0)**

Google Calendar is a time-management and scheduling calendar. You can view your schedule and sync it with your phone's built-in calendar seamlessly. You can sync it with Gmail, Docs, Drive, and more. I use it to schedule a lot of the stuff that I have to do in a day on it.

And I find it really helpful to schedule my tasks for the day.

Scheduling is the art of planning your activities so that you can achieve your goals and priorities in the time you have available. When it's done effectively, scheduling your tasks helps you:

* Understand what you can realistically achieve with your time.
* Make sure you have enough time for essential tasks.
* Add contingency time for "the unexpected."
* Avoid taking on more than you can handle.
* Work steadily toward your personal and career goals.
* Have enough time for family and friends, exercise, and hobbies.
* Achieve a good balance with everything.

Scheduling helps you think about what you want to achieve in a day, week or month, and it keeps you on track to accomplish your goals.

### **[Forest App](https://www.forestapp.cc/)**

It is literally a timer. But, with some more cool features that might help you to focus more. The best part of it is that you can kinda visually see what's going on (if that makes any sense).

Every time you focus, you choose the type of tree to plant, and your tree grows when the time is up. Easy!

With the deep focus mode, your plant withers if you leave the app. However, if you want to stay on the app, you can switch that off. Other features include tracking your focus durations, Forest timeline which allows you to track every moment of your planting journey, plant together where if anyone in a group touches their phones everyone’s plants wither, and their ability to plant real trees even with virtual coins. Today, more than 800,000 real trees were planted on Earth by Forest app users. These features allow you to keep track of the time you spend on your phone each day.

Some of these features require you to buy them but you can use this app without buying it too.

Thank you for reading!
