## Empty Your Cup: A Zen Proverb on Opening Yourself to New Ideas

As we grow older, we get filled with different ideas and experiences. This shapes us and the way we think and these help us make better decisions and learn from our mistakes. But, sometimes we need to open ourselves to new ideas and be willing to change our preconceptions.

We are filled with so much of our own opinions and knowledge that we are not willing to understand what a person is saying. It is so important to empty our cups and be open to new ideas and different opinions.

This is a famous proverb about a teacup (there are multiple versions of this but this one is my favorite).

Once upon a time, there was a wise Zen master. People traveled from far away to seek help. In return, he would teach them and show them the way to enlightenment.

On this particular day, a scholar came to visit the master for advice. *“I have come to ask you to teach me about Zen,”* the scholar said. Soon, it became obvious that the scholar was full of his own opinions and knowledge. He interrupted the master repeatedly with his own stories and failed to listen to what the master had to say. The master calmly suggested that they should have tea.

So the master poured his guest a cup. The cup was filled, yet he kept pouring until the cup overflowed onto the table, onto the floor, and finally onto the scholar’s robes. The scholar cried *“Stop! The cup is full already. Can’t you see?”*

> “Exactly,” the Zen master replied with a smile. “You are like this cup — so full of ideas that nothing more will fit in. Come back to me with an empty cup.”

This story reminds us that we need to stay humble, open ourselves to new ideas, and be willing to change our preconceptions.

This is so easy to say but extremely hard to practice.
