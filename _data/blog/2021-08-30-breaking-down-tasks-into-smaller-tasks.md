I like to write down the tasks somewhere. It helps me concentrate on the task, instead of thinking about all of the tasks I need to get done. And breaking down tasks into smaller tasks has helped a lot.

### Breaking tasks down into smaller tasks that are more achievable.

It helps us focus on the task more easily than just writing down the main task. \
Writing down the small tasks can make it easier for us to achieve the given tasks.

When we're faced with a big task, we might get overwhelmed and procrastinate. So, breaking down the tasks into smaller components helps.

#### Breaking down tasks makes it less intimidating to perform the task.

Sometimes, we just feel like adding a lot of the things to our to-do list. But, doing that sometimes makes us feel overwhelmed and not being able to complete any of them. Big tasks sometimes make it seem impossible to complete.

Tasks that require hours of focus can make us feel stressed, but when we break them down into tiny fragments that can be completed in 30-40 minutes, it becomes much easier for us to get the task done.

Thank you so much for reading!
